# 📘 Problem Statement

Agricultural productivity is severely affected by plant diseases that often go unnoticed until significant damage occurs, leading to major crop losses. Traditional disease detection relies on manual inspection by experts, which is slow, subjective, and often inaccessible to farmers in rural areas.  
There is a need for an **automated, accurate, scalable, and fast plant disease detection system** that can classify plant diseases directly from leaf images.

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system capable of identifying plant diseases using image classification techniques, enabling timely decision-making and reducing crop losses.

# 🎯 Scope of the Project

The scope includes:
- Using machine learning and deep learning models (ResNet50 / VGG16).
- Detecting and classifying **39 different plant diseases**.
- Implementing both:
  - 🌐 Web-based prediction system  
  - 📱 Mobile app with on-device TensorFlow Lite model  
- Providing disease name, symptoms, and possible management steps.
- Supporting farmers, gardeners, researchers, and agriculture stakeholders.
- Ensuring scalable, fast, and user-friendly diagnosis through image recognition.
