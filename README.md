# 🌱 Plant Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Plant Disease Prediction System is an image-based machine learning solution that identifies plant diseases from leaf images. Using deep learning (ResNet50/VGG16), image processing, and transfer learning, the system classifies plant leaves into one of **39 disease/healthy categories**.  
The project includes both a **Streamlit-based web application** and a **TensorFlow Lite powered Android mobile application**.

This system helps farmers, gardeners, and agriculture professionals diagnose crop diseases early and take timely action to reduce crop losses.
